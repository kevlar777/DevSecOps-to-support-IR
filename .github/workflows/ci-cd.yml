# Automated Incident Response in DevSecOps

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the integration of automated incident response within a DevSecOps pipeline. The goal is to identify security incidents in real-time, automate responses to those incidents, and ensure continuous security and compliance in the development lifecycle.

## Features
- Continuous Security Monitoring
- Automated Incident Detection
- Automated Incident Response
- Logging and Alerting
- Compliance Checks

## Technologies and Tools
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Security Tools: Trivy, Aqua Security, Falco, ELK Stack
- Scripting: Python, Bash
- Automation: Ansible, Terraform
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Incident Response: SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Wazuh)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
3. Configure Docker and build the images.
4. Set up security monitoring tools and configure logging.
5. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.
6. Run the Ansible playbooks for automated incident response.

## Usage
- Push code changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
- Monitor security incidents using the ELK stack and Prometheus.
- Respond to incidents automatically using Ansible playbooks.

## Documentation
Refer to the `docs` folder for detailed documentation on each component and workflow.
# Project Architecture

## Overview
This project integrates automated incident response within a DevSecOps pipeline, utilizing various tools and technologies to ensure continuous security and compliance.

## Components
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Containerization:** Docker for containerizing applications.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for orchestrating container deployments.
- **Security Monitoring:** Trivy, Aqua Security, Falco for security scanning and monitoring.
- **Logging:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and analysis.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring.
- **Incident Response:** Ansible for automating incident response actions.

## Workflow
1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code changes to the repository.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions build, test, and deploy the application.
3. **Security Scanning:** Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.
4. **Deployment:** Docker images are deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana monitor the application and infrastructure.
6. **Logging:** ELK Stack collects and analyzes logs.
7. **Incident Detection:** Falco detects security incidents in real-time.
8. **Incident Response:** Ansible playbooks automate response actions.
